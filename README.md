# Smart City Analytics and Management

## Introduction
In today's rapidly urbanizing world, cities are embracing digital transformation to become smarter, more efficient, and sustainable. The **Smart City Analytics and Management** project aims to revolutionize urban decision-making by harnessing the power of data analytics, cloud technologies, and real-time data integration.

## Project Overview
This project leverages **Azure cloud computing** technologies to process, analyze, and visualize large-scale urban data. By combining static datasets from sources like Kaggle's Smart Cities Index with future integration of real-time data streams (e.g., CitySDK, OpenTraffic), we aim to empower cities with actionable insights for better planning and management.

## Key Features
- **Static Data Analysis**: Extract insights from urban datasets to identify patterns and trends.
- **Real-Time Data Integration** (Future Work): Incorporate live data streams for dynamic and immediate analytics.
- **Azure-Powered Architecture**: Utilize services like Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI for a complete data lifecycle from ingestion to visualization.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Deliver real-time, interactive dashboards for policymakers and the public using Power BI.
- **Security and Compliance**: Ensure data protection and compliance using Azure Active Directory and Key Vault.

## Technologies Used
- **Azure Data Factory**
- **Azure Databricks**
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**
- **Power BI**
- **Azure Active Directory**
- **Azure Key Vault**
- **SQL Server**

## Dataset
- **Smart Cities Index** (from Kaggle)
  - Metrics include: Smart Mobility, Smart Environment, Smart Government, Smart Economy, Smart People, Smart Living, and overall SmartCity Index.

## Architecture
The solution integrates:
- Data ingestion with Azure Data Factory
- Data storage using Data Lake Gen2
- Data processing and transformation with Databricks
- Advanced analytics with Synapse Analytics
- Interactive dashboards with Power BI
- Secure access control and key management

## Future Work
- Integration of real-time data streams (CitySDK, OpenTraffic)
- Enhanced predictive analytics with Azure Machine Learning
- Expansion of dashboards for deeper stakeholder engagement
- Implementation of advanced security measures like Azure Confidential Computing
